# This is a  brief demo of how to work with different data types as well as assigning values to variables.

# This illustrates a string
# Always enclose a string in either single or double quotation marks
#Python 3.10 also allows use of back ticks to represent a string.
x = "Hello World"

#An interger is a whole number or a number without any decimal point
x =5		

#A floating point number is a number with a decimal point
x = 80.3	

#This is a complex number
x = 1j	

#A list is represented by variables enclosed in a square bracket.
x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]	

#Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
#A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")		

#A range 
x = range(8)	

#A dictionary
x = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36}	

#A set
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}		

A frozenset
x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"})		

#A boolean
x = True	
y = False

#Bytes
x = b"Hello"		

# try some of these key terms out
# Variable to store a value
name = "John"  

# Reassign variable
name = "Jane" 

# f-String prints variable 
print(f"Hello {name}")

# Integer
num = 10  

# Float 
dec = 10.5 

# Boolean
is_true = False

# None 
empty = None

# If condition evaluates the Boolean
if is_true:
  print("Condition was true")

# Else catches when if was False  
else: 
  print("Condition was false")
  
# Try block attempts this code
try:
  result = num / 0
# Except catches the ZeroDivisionError   
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
  print("Cannot divide by 0")

#Bytearray
x = bytearray(5)		

#memoryview
x = memoryview(bytes(5))
