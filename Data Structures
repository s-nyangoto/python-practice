"""
Key Terms
List - An ordered collection of values enclosed in square brackets []. Useful for storing sequences of items.

Index - The numeric position of an item in a list. Starts at 0 for first item. Used to access items by position.

Iteration - Repeated execution of code on successive list items. Done in Python with a for-in loop.

Dictionary - Unordered collection of key-value pairs denoted with curly braces {}. Keys map to associated values.

Key - Unique identifier that is used to look up values in a dictionary. Looks up are very fast.

Value - Data associated with a given key in a dictionary. Values can be any Python data type.

Tuple - Fixed-size, immutable ordered collection similar to a list. Denoted with (). Useful when data shouldn't change.

Set - Unordered collection of unique objects. Helpful for removing duplicates and set operations.

Membership - Ability to check if a value is contained in a collection like lists, dictionaries, tuples, or sets.

Methods - Built-in functions that allow manipulating and interacting with data structures.

Iteration - The process of repeatedly executing code on each item in a collection one by one.

Adding and Extracting Data from Data Structures

Key Terms:
Append - Adds an item to the end of a list

Insert - Inserts an item at a specified index in a list

Extend - Appends all items from one list onto another

Pop - Removes and returns an item at a specified index

Get - Safely gets a dictionary value falling back to a default
