==Introduction to NumPy arrays==
NumPy (Numerical Python) is an essential library for working with dimensional arrays (matrices and vectors). 

Because NumPy has optimizations it is usually much faster than working with Python when processing data.

=====Key Terms=====
Array: Primary data structure in NumPy, represented as homogeneous n-dimensional grid of values.

Reshape: Transform an array into a new shape with same number of elements.

Ravel: Flatten an array into one dimensional shape.

Stack: Vertically or horizontally concatenate arrays.

Slice: Extract subset of array elements using indexing.
'''
import numpy as np

# Create array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3]) 
print(arr)

# Reshape 
arr = arr.reshape(1, 3)
print(arr)  

# Ravel (flatten)
flattened = arr.ravel() 

# Stack vertically  
arr1 = np.array([1, 2])
arr2 = np.array([3, 4])
stacked = np.vstack([arr1, arr2])  

# Slice
sliced = arr[0:2]


With an activated virtual environment, install the library:
```
```
$ pip install numpy
```
import numpy as np
Arrays are homogenous, that is, its items must be of the same type (unlike a Python list)
## Create arrays with lists
# single dimension arrays

array = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
array
# two dimensions

array = np.array([[1,2],[2,2]])
print(array.shape)
array
## Create arrays with built-in functions
# 2x2 array with random floats of 0 to 1
np.random.rand(2,2)
# fill out the 3x4 array with the number 7
np.full((3,4), 8)
# using the number 1 is so common that `ones` is a function!
np.ones((4,4))
# a simple sequence from 0 to 4
np.arange(0,5)
# a sequence with three steps from 0 to 27
np.arange(0, 27, 3)

# More array operations

import numpy as np
## Expanding arrays
# create a single dimension array
array = np.ones((4,))
print(array)
print(array.shape)

# expand one row
expanded = array[np.newaxis, :]
expanded.shape
## Conditional new arrays
array = np.array([[3,12,11],[45,22,11],[56,15,22]])
# represent all matching conditions
print(array < 20)
# produce all matching values
array[array < 20]
## Slicing

Similar to Python lists, but with more features and capabilities
a = np.arange(6)
a
# give a range
a[1:4]
## Stacking

# horizontally
# must have same number of dimensions!
first = np.full((2, 12), 2)
print(first)
second = np.full((2, 7), 2)
print(second)
np.hstack((first, second))
# stacking vertically
first = np.full((3,3), 1)
print(first)
second = np.full((3,3), 2)
print(second)
np.vstack((first, second))


## Splitting arrays
array = np.arange(1, 11)
array
# split into two equal parts
# warning it needs to allow for an equal division!
np.hsplit(array, 2)

# this allows for "unpacking"
first, second = np.hsplit(array, 2)
print(first)
print(second)
