import pandas as pd

# Create data frame 
data = [[1, 2], [3, 4]] 
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['Num1', 'Num2'], index=['R1', 'R2'])
print(df)

# Create series
s = df['Num1']
print(s)

# Load CSV file into data frame
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv') 

# Exploratory analysis
print(df.describe())

# Export data frame to CSV
df.to_csv('export.csv')
