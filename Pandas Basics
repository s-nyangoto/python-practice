Data frame: A two-dimensional data structure inside Pandas similar to a spreadsheet, with columns and rows.

Series: A one-dimensional array with axis labels, usually created from a Pandas data frame column.

Loading: The process of reading external data into a Pandas data frame.

Exploratory analysis: Initial investigation of data to understand its characteristics before further analysis.

Exporting: Saving data from a Pandas data frame out to another format like CSV or Excel.

## Loading data into Pandas

There are different ways to load data into Pandas. The library is extremely flexible allowing you to work with different popular data formats. This notebook will show you how to load from different sources which include both local and remote.
### Create a Pandas Frame from an online CSV
Note that this requires a publicly available repository in Github (for this example). A private repo will require auth.

df.head(10)

## Load a CSV from a local file
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("test.csv")
print(df)

## Load JSON from a local file
df = pd.read_json("test.json")
